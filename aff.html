                    <h4 class="grid-header">Intro</h4>
                    <p>AFF stands for Accelerated Free Fall. This might be a bit misleading. Skydivers do not accelerate
                        during free fall, only the first few seconds when leaving the aircraft until terminal velocity
                        (approximately 200km/h).AFF was introduced quite a while ago as the new standard for a basic
                        skydive course.</p>
                    <p> Former skydive courses started with 'automatic opening' jumps (whereby the
                        openingsystem of the parachute is linked with the aircraft) and a freefall part later during the
                        course. The AFF program includes free faal as from the first jump ('accelerated' compared with
                        the old system). There are some small differences in each country or region, but this training
                        program can be considered as the global standard.</p>

                <section class="three-paragraphs">
                    <h4 class="grid-header">Course content</h4>
                    <p>The AFF course starts with a short day of theoretical instruction. The instruction includes
                        information about your gear (container/parachute system), normal procedures, non-normal
                        procedures (i.e; when and how to use the reserve), freefall body position, freefall excersises,
                        flying under canopy (parachute), landing pattern, landing(flare),... Everything you need to
                        know. The theoretical course is concluded by a small written test.
                        When all goes well, and the weather is good, you will do you first jump on the same day!</p>
                    <p>The practical course consists of 7 levels. Each level is 1 jump. The first three levels you will
                        be accompanied by two instructors. They assure you keep the correct body position (belly to
                        earth) and check your predefined excercises. When you executed those exercises correctly while
                        maintaining the correct body position and keeping altitude awareness, you can proceed to the
                        next level. As from level 4, only one instructor will be along your side during the freefall.
                        And yes, you understood well, once you open your parachute (or when you're instructor opened
                        your parachute should you fail to do so), you're alone under your canopy. No worries, your
                        instructor will guide you over the radio to your landing spot.</p>
                    <p>Some people succeed passing the course in 7 jumps. Most likely, a retake on one or more jumps
                        will be required. However, most people pass the course in less than 10 jumps. A lot depends on
                        the timeframe of your course. Ideally, you should complete the course over two/three weekends,
                        which is not always possible due to weather or your own availability. And yes, weather
                        restrictions are stricter for apprentices (highly regulated remember?).</p>
