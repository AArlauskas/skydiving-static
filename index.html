                            Simply, to jump from an aircraft with a parachute.
                            The key elements here are "aircraft" and "parachute".
                            An "aircraft" has to be just that: a vehicle moving through the air.
                            The aircraft doesn't have to be an airplane - it can be an airplane,
                            a helicopter, a hot-air balloon, a microlight, a paraglider with a tandem harness to jump
                            from,
                            or whatever that flies.
                            The "parachute" must be present, but it doesn't have to be of any particular kind.
                            It can be an old-school round or a modern ram-air (square) number.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These days, it's almost always the latter. Important to know, skydives are performed using a
                            "two-parachute system,"
                            which comprises of a "container" (the backpack into which the fabric is folded) and two
                            parachutes: the main canopy
                            and the backup parachute (or "reserve") in case the main one malfunctions. In most skydiving
                            systems, there's a device installed which opens the reserve parachute in the eventuality
                            that
                            the skydiver does not,
                            or is not able to open his/her own parachute unaided. The use of these failsafes and the
                            fact
                            that skydiving is heavily regulated results in a marvelous
                            statistical safety.

                <h3>Who can skydive?</h3>
                <p>
                    Anyone looking for a thrill or adrenaline rush can sign up for a tandemjump. However, if you are
                    considering to start a full skydive course, thrill-seeking should not be your main goal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Skydiving is a dangerous activity that can be done safely. Therefore a good (safe) skydiver is
                    self-confident, is stress resistant and above all, is disciplined!

                <p><strong>Skydiving is not risking your life on every jump!</strong> Skydiving can be done safely. It
                    should not be confused with base-jumping. Although very similar parachutes are used, basejumps start
                    from fixed surfaces (b.a.s.e. stands for building, antenna, span, earth or roughly a 'base').</p>
                <p>They use a single parachute system, jump from (very) low altitudes, often close to obstacles and are
                    not regulated.</p>
                <p>Paragliding, paramotor, parasailing all use parachute systems but is does not include a free fall
                    portion nor do they start from an aircraft having their parachute packed in a container on their
                    back.</p>

                        A tandem skydive is a skydiving experience where two people jump out of an airplane together,
                        strapped to one another during the entire descent. The connecting straps make it so that one
                        person is floating above the other during the freefall, with one’s back against the other’s
                        frontside.

                        In skydiving, we are fans of getting people from point a (the ground) to point b (the air) as
                        quickly as is safely possible. For students, this is where AFF comes in. AFF is the acronym for
                        <strong>“Accelerated Freefall.”</strong> AFF is the quickest, most efficient method of skydiving
                        training to get you in the air on a solo skydive.
